         <h2>Where Do Teachers Come From? Well, It's Not the Stork.</h2>
         <p>
            In the town of Chiaravalle, Italy on August 31, 1870, Alessandro and Renilde (ne&#769;e Stoppani) Montessori welcomed into the world a daugther who would be one of Education's greatest minds.  They named her Maria.  
            Alessandro had been a soldier in his younger years and became a civil servant later.  Renilde, who was eight years younger than Alessandro, had a love of reading and was quite well educated.  This was super 
            unusual, because in their small town, it was a big deal to even be able to write one's name. Renilde was super patriotic.  She was wildly devoted to the liberation and union of Italy.  Alessandro and Renilde 
            were married in 1866 and a year later, Maria was born.

         <h2>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?</h2>
         <p>
            In late 1874, the family moved to Rome.  Maria was enrolled in the local state school in 1876.  She was an extremely gifted child and as she continued to grow, she was breaking glass ceilings all over the place. 
            As a kid, she wanted to be an engineer.  That was her intention when she began her studies at the Regio Istituto Tecnico Leonardo da Vincini in 1886.  This was already a weird thing for a girl to do.  Most girls 
            who even went on to get a secondary education studied the classics, probably like "How to be a Subserviant Wife 101" and "Cookin', Cleanin', and Changin' Diapers 302".  At least that's what I imagine they studied.  
            But not our girl, Maria was all about joining the ranks of men.

         <h2>Breaking into the Boys&apos; Club</h2>
         <p>
            When she graduated from technical school, Maria&apos;s parents tried to talk her into becoming a teacher, because it was really one of few things that were open to a women.  Too bad Maria had other plans.  She was determined
            to go to med school.  Alessandro was not cool with this idea because it was an all male field and it would be improper.  No worries, Papa Montessori, because the head of the school refused to let her in.  It's said that 
            she ended her meeting with that dude by saying &quot;I know I shall become a doctor&quot;.  Finally after getting a thumbs up from Pope Leo XIII, she enrolled in the University of Rome in 1890.  While there, she studied physics, 
            mathematics, and natural sciences, thus becoming one of the first women in med school in Italy.  
         </p>
         <p>   
            This didn&apos;t make it any easier though, she had to put up with a ton of junk just because she was female.  For instance, she couldn't study cadavers with her classmates, whether the subject was male or female, because it
            was improper for women and men to be in mixed company around naked bodies.  So, she had to come in at night when everyone else had gone home and study the cadavers then.  Despite dealing with so many disadvantages, Maria 
            officially became a doctor in July 1896.

         <h2>Workin' 9-5</h2>
         <p>
            During her early medical career, Maria became interested in the Women's Rights movement.  She made a name for herself due to both her competency in treating patients and the respect she showed to everyone, including those of 
            lower social classes.  In 1897, she volunteered in a research program at the psychiatric clinic of the University of Rome.  Her work there fostered an interest in the needs of children with learning disabilites.  Her scientific 
            mind couldn't resist learning all she could on learning differences.  She studied the works of Jean-Marc Itard and Edouard Seguin.  The former was famous for his work with "the wild boy of Aveyron" and the later was his student. 
            Soon, Maria was named co-director of a new institution called the Orthphrenic School.  She gave birth to her one and only child, Mario in 1898.  Most of the information I have ever read about Maria says that she had a secret affair 
            with another doctor and wouldn't tell anyone who had fathered Mario.  However, more recently, it seems that we have found a name, Giusseppe Montesano, her codirector at the school.       
         </p>
         <p>
            By 28, Maria began advocating for her theory that the lack of support was the cause of the deliquency of mentally and developmentally disabled children.  This was a controversial theory, obviously, people don't like to be told they're
            wrong by someone they don't think worthy of respect.  But, Maria was not one to back off a fight against social norms.  Social reform was a huge part of Maria's entire life, whether gender roles, unwed motherhood, or advocacy for children, 
            this woman was down to pick a well-educated, well-researched fight and see it through.

            From 1901-1908, Maria began lecturing and teaching students thestudy of educational philosophy and anthropology, particularly at the University of Rome.  At that time, Rome was quickly developing, but there were also many bankruptcies and
            ghetto districts.  Children were left to their own devices all day while they're parents worked.  Maria was offered the opportunity to practice and observe the use of her created materials to practice on "normal" children.  In 1907, in the 
            ghetto of San Lorenzo, Maria opened the first Casa dei Bambini (Children's House).

         <p>
            As a scientist, Maria took great care to put many different activies and other materials into the children's environment, but through her diligent observation, she only kept the ones that engaged the children.  She came to understand that
            children who were in an environment with activities that were designed to support their natural development could educate themselves.  In 1909, she started training others in her mehtods and published a book in Italy.  That book is now 
            translated into about 20 languages.  Maria was very careful to ensure that all her adult students knew the importance of a prepared environment, sensetive periods in development, and that they were first observers and second educators.  
            She traveled the world taking her method and materials to Montessori societies worldwide.

            For a time (around 1929), Maria lived in Spain.  Mario and his wife, Helen Christy, soon followed and raised their four children; Mario jr, Rolando, Marilena, and Renilde.  Together, Maria and Mario established the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI)
            to keep her work active around the world.  AMI is still quite active and Montessori schools and educators often seek to adhere to the regulations set by the association.  Upon her death in 1952, Maria left Mario in charge of carrying on her legacy.  He held fast 
            to Maria's prinicples and continued her work till his death in 1982.  Her grandchildren then took over in one way or another, sharing her legacy and movement with the world.

            As fascism rose in Europe, the progress of the Montessori movement was greatly impacted.  In Germany, the Nazis had closed all of the Montessori schools by 1933.  Mussolini followed suit, but that was more about hurt pride.  Mussolini was enthralled by Montessori's 
            system that he agreed to serve as Honorary President of the Montessori Society of Italy.  He allowed Maria to open a teacher's training college and Casa dei Bambinis all over Italy.  But soon, Maria's ideological viewpoints, particularly as a pacifist, upset Mussolini
            and the relationship began to sour.  In 1931, she basically told Mussolini to kick rocks when he demanded that she order her teachers to take the Fascist loyalty oath.  This challenge of his authority made Mussolini furious.  He closed all Montessori schools in Italy.  
            Maria had to flee italy in 1934 due to the harassment she received from Mussolini.

            When Italy and Great Britain were at war in 1940, Maria was teaching in India.  Britain forced all Italian nationals within it's borders or it's colonies into internment.  Mario was forced into internment, while Maria was restricted to the Theosophical Society compound 
            as a teacher.  As she couldn't return to Italy, she spent the remainder of World War II in exile, in India.  She spent her time there developing her idea of Cosmic Education for children ages 6-12. This idea stems from her time of reflection on the nature of the 
            relationships among all living things. For her 70th birthday, she asked the Indian government to release Mario.  Her wish was granted and together they trained over 1,500 Indian teachers.  During her time in India, she enriched her philosophy and approach to education.  
            She had the opportunity to meet Gandhi, Nehru, and Tagore.

            <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p>
               Maria Montessori had built a legacy that would stretch across the world.  She touched the lives of many children and changed the very course of history.  She paved the way for women all over the world to take a stand for what they believe in and keep pushing forward 
               through adversity.  Though it was never stated, one could assume that she realized the advantages she did receive as a women from a fairly well-off family. She sought to build others up and to prove that all children could learn.  She truly sought to give each child the world.
